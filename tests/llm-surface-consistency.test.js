 * one surface keeps a retired price, another omits the promoted offer, a third
 * links to a file that no longer exists. Readers — human and LLM — then get a
 * different answer depending on which surface they happened to land on.
 *
 * This suite pins the canonical facts to a single source each (package.json for
 * identity/version, the Stripe revenue catalog for commercial terms, the server
 * router for which file is actually served) and asserts every published surface
 * agrees. Expected values are DERIVED, never duplicated here — a test that
